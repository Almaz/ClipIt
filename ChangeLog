ClipIt-v1.3.2-22112010001 - 22 Nov. 2010
	+ Fixed: Fixed most of the markup and indentation (replaced double spaces
			with tabs).
	+ Fixed: Removed clipboard restoring from history, as this seems to cause
			more problems than it solves.

ClipIt-v1.3.1-17112010001 - 17 Nov. 2010
	+ Added: Added autostart support for LXDE.
	+ Fixed: Fixed problem with "Edit" window not appearing.

ClipIt-v1.3.0-14112010001 - 14 Nov. 2010
	+ Added: Added "Edit" and "Remove" buttons to the "Manage History" dialog.
	+ Fixed: Major speed improvements for big history entries while:
			searching through the history;
			populating the "Manage History" dialog;
			generating the popup menus;
		All of these should now be more than 99% faster, at the expense
		of an (at most) 1MB overhead. I think it's worth it, though.
	+ Fixed: Fixed a drawing issue with the small history menu when activated
			by clicking on the systray icon.

ClipIt-v1.2.6-12112010003 - 12 Nov. 2010

ClipIt-v1.2.5-12112010002 - 12 Nov. 2010
	+ Fixed: Now using autopoint instead of gettextize to avoid waiting for
			user input.
	+ Fixed: Added AM_MAINTAINER_MODE, to get rid of the disable-maintainer-mode
			warning.
	+ Fixed: Fixed a small typo in main.c.
	+ Fixed: removed dependency of pthread.h (the pthread_exit function that we
			use is also included in glib.h).

ClipIt-v1.2.4-12112010001 - 12 Nov. 2010
	+ Fixed: Fixed 2 small omitions from previous changes.

ClipIt-v1.2.3-11112010002 - 11 Nov. 2010
	+ Fixed: Fixed the manpage so it now aligns to the conventions for 
			writing Linux man pages.

			are included.

ClipIt-v1.2.0-10112010001 - 10 Nov. 2010

ClipIt-v1.0.0-05112010001 - 05 Nov. 2010
	Changes from Parcellite 0.9.2:

		+ Ability to put the button for the "Full history" in the systray menu.
		+ Created a Search function, which allows searching through history.
		+ Added Search hotkey.
		+ Created Exceptions:
			you can enter C or Perl regex into the window and
			the items that match the regex won't be saved in
			the history. This allows you to except passwords
			or specific links from being included in the
			history.
		+ Removed some of the warning messages that make threw at us.
